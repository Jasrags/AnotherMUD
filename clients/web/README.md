# AnotherMUD — Web Client (P1)

A pure-browser client over the **existing** WebSocket + GMCP wire
(`internal/conn/ws`). It is the **P1 "superset baseline"** from
[`docs/themes/web-client-plan.md`](../../docs/themes/web-client-plan.md): a
browser *view* that sends `command` envelopes, renders `text` frames (ANSI →
HTML), and consumes the engine's GMCP packages into a HUD — with **zero server
changes**.

No build step, no dependencies — three static files (`index.html`, `app.css`,
`app.js`).

## What it shows

- **Terminal** — full ANSI colour (16-colour + 24-bit truecolour), scrollback,
  command history (↑/↓), local echo, and password masking (WebSocket has no
  telnet echo negotiation, so the client masks locally when the prompt asks for
  a password).
- **HUD panels**, driven live by GMCP:
  - **Vitals** — HP + every resource pool from `Char.Vitals`, including the
    generalized `pools` map (a WoT channeler's One Power via `mana`, a Shadowrun
    runner's `essence`/`stun`). Renders any world's resources without hardcoding.
  - **Combat** — target + target HP from `Char.Combat`.
  - **Location** — name/area/terrain/light/coords from `Room.Info`, clickable
    exit chips (each sends the matching move command), and a **coordinate
    minimap** plotting the rooms you've seen on the current z-plane.
  - **Effects** — active effects from `Char.Effects`.
  - **Progression** — per-track level/XP bars from `Char.Experience`.
  - **Identity** — name/account/race/class from `Char.Login` + `Char.Status`.

Everything is a view: clicking an exit just sends the `north`/`south`/… command
the server already accepts. The client holds no game logic (the P1 authority
invariant).

## Run it

### The quick way — `make run-web`

```bash
make run-web            # starter-world + WebSocket on :4001, opens the client
```

This boots the engine with the WS listener on `:4001`, relaxes the origin check
for local dev, and opens `index.html`. Just press **Connect** (the default URL
`ws://localhost:4001/mud` already matches). For a themed world's richer HUD,
compose the flag with any world target:

```bash
make run-shadowrun WS_ADDR=:4001   # essence + stun bars
make run-wot        WS_ADDR=:4001   # the One Power (create a channeler)
make watch-wot      WS_ADDR=:4001   # …with live-reload
```

### The manual way

### 1. Start the server with the WebSocket listener on

The WS listener is **off by default**. Enable it (and, for a browser opened from
`file://` or a different port, relax the origin check for local dev):

```bash
ANOTHERMUD_WS_ADDR=:4001 \
ANOTHERMUD_WS_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY=true \
go run ./cmd/anothermud
```

- `ANOTHERMUD_WS_ADDR=:4001` — the WebSocket listen address (empty = disabled).
- `ANOTHERMUD_WS_PATH=/mud` — the route (default `/mud`).
- `ANOTHERMUD_WS_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY=true` — **dev only.** Skips the WS origin
  check so a page served from `file://` (origin `null`) or a static file server
  on another port can connect. In production set `ANOTHERMUD_WS_ORIGINS` to your
  real origin(s) instead.

For a Shadowrun or WoT boot (to see `essence`/`stun` or the One Power on the HUD):

```bash
ANOTHERMUD_PACKS=shadowrun ANOTHERMUD_WS_ADDR=:4001 \
ANOTHERMUD_WS_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY=true go run ./cmd/anothermud
```

### 2. Open the client

Either just open the file:

```bash
open clients/web/index.html        # macOS
```

…or serve the folder (any static server works):

```bash
cd clients/web && python3 -m http.server 8080
# then browse http://localhost:8080
```

### 3. Connect

The URL field defaults to `ws://localhost:4001/mud`. Press **Connect**, then log
in through the normal prompts (create an account / character just like telnet).

## Notes / limits (P1)

- **`ws://` is unencrypted.** For anything past localhost use `wss://` behind a
  TLS terminator; see the WebSocket TLS/rate-limit deferral (`m16-5`).
- **No enriched packages yet.** P1 consumes only the *existing* 11 GMCP packages.
  Rich additive packages (interactive map beyond `Room.Info`, structured
  inventory, forms) are **P2+** — see the plan doc. `Char.Items.List`,
  `Char.StatusVars`, `Comm.Channel.Text`, and `Char.Wizard` arrive on the wire
  but aren't surfaced yet (dispatched to a no-op, so they never error).
- **Password masking is a heuristic** (the prompt text mentions "password").
  It's a local convenience, not a security boundary.
